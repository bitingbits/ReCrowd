# ReCrowd
ReCrowd is the newest solution to manage crowds for big events and themeparks. The application fully utilizes the location of the app user by offering rewards based on the user going to certain locations in the event/the themepark. Because the app influences the current location of its user, the crowds can be split up or thinned out significantly. 

ReCrowd offers its event full back-end management options so they are always in control of how they reward their visitors and how hard it is to get these rewards.
